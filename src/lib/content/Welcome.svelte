<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>
	To my portolio! I am a student at <a href="https://www.enseeiht.fr/">ENSEEIHT</a>, a top-ranking
	engineering school based in Toulouse.
</p>

<br />

<p>
	Curious and passionate about computer science and space. With multiple internship experiences and
	active involvement in associations, I have mastered a wide range of technologies.

<p>
	But why does this portfolio look like this? It's a tribute to the first computer I ever used, the
	iMac G3 with MacOS 9. I wanted to recreate the experience of using it with its vintage design. For
	a better experience, I recommend using a desktop computer and enable full screen.
